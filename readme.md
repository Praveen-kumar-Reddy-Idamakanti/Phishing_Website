# Cybersecurity Awareness & Penetration Testing Demo

## Overview

This project is a **Cybersecurity Awareness & Penetration Testing Demo** designed to educate individuals and organizations on the risks associated with phishing attacks and social engineering techniques. The simulation replicates a phishing attack scenario in a controlled and legal environment. The goal is to highlight potential vulnerabilities and demonstrate countermeasures to improve overall security posture.

## Project Purpose

- **Educational Demonstration:** To show how attackers might exploit user trust through phishing pages.
- **Awareness:** To educate users on the dangers of sharing credentials on non-verified platforms.
- **Defensive Strategies:** To provide insight into how simulated attacks can reveal security weaknesses and inform better security practices.
- **Ethical Hacking:** To serve as a proof-of-concept for penetration testing in a legal, ethical, and controlled manner.

## Features

- **Simulated Login Interface:** A landing page mimicking a well-known social media login to simulate a phishing scenario.
- **Credential Simulation:** Demonstrates how credentials can be captured in a controlled, non-destructive manner.
- **Geolocation Tracking:** Shows the potential risks of location tracking by simulating the retrieval of geolocation data.
- **Cookie Simulation:** Illustrates how cookies might be harvested during an attack scenario.
- **Automated Data Packaging:** Demonstrates the concept of automated file download and packaging (ZIP file creation) to mimic data exfiltration.
